			There is no knowledge in the multiverse that the library doesn't have. Every book is unique and the reader will find the real original text in here. Every book holds the occurence of true events, nothing in the books in here is fictional.

			<span>WARNING : No book in the library should be destroyed, doing so is a punishable offence!!!</span>
